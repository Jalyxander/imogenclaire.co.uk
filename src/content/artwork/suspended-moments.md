A morden study of Vanitas, attributed to PHilippe de Champaigne (1646), captures the delicate poise between vitality and of beauty held just before its departure. A blossom, radiant in scarlet and gold, rises from its glass vessel with sculptural intensity. Its petals reach outward in graceful tension, as though caught mid-bloom, echoing nature’s impulse to endure and unfurl.

Beside it, an hourglass rests within its wooden frame, its golden sand halted in liminal stillness. Time has paused—not erased, but tempered—inviting reflection rather than rush. The dark backdrop enfolds both subjects in quiet solemnity, sharpening their presence while inviting introspection.
