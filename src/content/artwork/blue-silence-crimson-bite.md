A meditation on mortality and the passage of time, rendered in the classical vanitas tradition. The composition juxtaposes symbols of life and death, beauty and decay, inviting contemplation of our shared human condition. The dramatic lighting emphasizes the textures and symbolic weight of each carefully chosen object.
