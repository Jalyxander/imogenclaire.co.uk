In Midnight Feast, a single candle burns at the heart of the composition, its golden flame casting reverent illumination across a modest spread: red apples like bruised hearts, plump grapes clinging to the vine, a lemon glinting like faded sunlight. Nearby, the deep burgundy of wine waits untouched in its glass. A solelm feast when one cannot sleep.
