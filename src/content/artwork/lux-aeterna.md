In Lux Aeterna, the artist conjures a quiet requiem of warmth amidst shadow—a still life meditation where light becomes memory. A single candle burns at the heart of the composition, its golden flame casting reverent illumination across a solemn spread: red apples like bruised hearts, dusky grapes clinging to time, a lemon glinting like faded sunlight. Nearby, the deep burgundy of wine waits untouched in its glass, echoing silent communion, while a green glass pitcher catches remnants of the surrounding glow, its reflection rippling like a distant hymn.

The backdrop, dark and unobtrusive, allows each object to sing softly in its own register. Together, they evoke a hushed harmony: of transience, of abundance framed by impermanence. Where Echoes of the Forest explored rebirth through decay, Lux Aeterna finds the sacred in stillness—in a light held tenderly before it fades.

A study in quiet reverence, this piece invites contemplation: of the eternal in the ephemeral, and the hush between what was and what remains.
